      <p>When I present work, I always try to tell a story. Clients aren’t designers, so they need supporting visuals to understand what you’re showing them. These supporting visuals often come up as moodboards and mockups of your designs! Make sure to be clear, distinct, and direct with the direction(s) that you are showing your client.</p>

      <h2>MOODBOARDS</h2>
      <p>Moodboards are one of the most important parts of building trust with your client. It’s more than throwing together a slide of beautiful images, it’s about doing research about what designs your client loves and creating a story that shows you understand that.</p>

      <h2>MOCKUPS</h2>
      <p>Use online tools like Mockupworld, Graphicburger, Livesurface, or free mockups found on Behance to create mockups! Not all clients can take a flat design and visualize it in a 3D space and it helps you and your client to show them what your designs look like IRL.</p>
